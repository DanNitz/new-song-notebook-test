 Song Writing and Storage App

 Restarting my project from the beginning - To better understand the basics of APIs and functionality.

 This time around I am going to work on scalabilty, starting smaller. Build a skateboard first instead of a rocketship. MVP style. 

 1. Get the API and server running to display a list of my songs from songs.json
 2. Add a functions that will search out a particular song by its id, set, tuning, cover or original (co), and or name
 3. Add an insert method to be able to input new songs
 4. Add a router put and update method to update our constantly changing songs
 5. Add a delete method/endpoint to delete songs
 6. Add the patch method to be able to update partial data (will be most important feature in my case!)
 7. Add my Song library page to begin GET on Songs  
 8. npm install cors package and configuration 
 9. Work on xhr requests for getAllSongs() and getSet()
 10. Work on my displayAllSongs() using a while loop and forEach
