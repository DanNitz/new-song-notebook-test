 Song Writing and Storage App

 Restarting my project from the beginning - To better understand the basics of APIs and functionality.

 This time around I am going to work on scalabilty, starting smaller. Build a skateboard first instead of a rocketship. MVP style. 

 1. Get the API and server running to display a list of my songs from songs.json
 2. Add a functions that will search out a particular song by its id, set, tuning, cover or original (co), and or name
 3. Next add some more songs to json file to experiment with more search diversity
